            <h2>What This Exercise Was About</h2>
            <p>
                Exercise 2.5 was the milestone where all the individual components of Django—Models, Views, and Templates—truly came together to create a dynamic, interactive part of the application. The focus was on enhancing the project to handle images, display data from the database in a user-friendly way, and create clickable links between pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                This involved configuring the project to manage user-uploaded "media" files, using powerful Class-Based Views (`ListView` and `DetailView`) to reduce boilerplate code, and implementing dynamic URL routing that uses a recipe's unique ID (`pk`) to link from a list to its specific detail page. It felt like graduating from building static pages to creating a real, data-driven web application.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="done" class="section">
            <h2>What I Did (Step-by-Step)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Configured Media Files:</strong> I installed the `Pillow` library, created a `media/` directory, and configured `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` in `settings.py`. I also updated the project's `urls.py` to serve media files during development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Updated the Recipe Model:</strong> I added an `ImageField` to the `Recipe` model to store a picture for each recipe. I then ran `makemigrations` and `migrate` to apply this change to the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implemented Class-Based Views:</strong> In `recipes/views.py`, I created `RecipeListView` and `RecipeDetailView`. These generic views handle the logic for fetching all recipes and a single recipe, respectively, with just a few lines of code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Created Templates:</strong> I created the `recipes_list.html` and `recipes_detail.html` files inside the `recipes/templates/recipes/` directory. I used Django Template Language to loop through `object_list` and display recipe data, including the newly added images (`{{ object.pic.url }}`).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Set Up URL Routing:</strong> I created `recipes/urls.py` and defined paths for the list and detail views. The detail view path (`<pk>`) captures the recipe's ID from the URL. I then included this app-level URL file in the main project's `urls.py`.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enabled Dynamic Linking:</strong> I added the `get_absolute_url` method to the `Recipe` model. This method tells Django how to generate the specific URL for any given recipe object. I then used this in the list template (`<a href="{{ object.get_absolute_url }}">`) to make each recipe title a clickable link to its detail page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wrote Tests:</strong> I added a test to `recipes/tests.py` to verify that the `get_absolute_url` method returns the correct path, ensuring my URL configuration was working as expected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Styled the Pages:</strong> I applied a consistent CSS style across the homepage, recipe list, and recipe detail pages for a professional and cohesive user experience.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="issues" class="section">
            <h2>Issues I Hit & Fixes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>`IndentationError` in `models.py`:</strong> An early attempt to run migrations failed due to a stray indent on a comment line. **Fix:** Python's sensitivity to whitespace is a constant lesson! I carefully reviewed the file and removed the extra spaces to align the comment correctly with the class attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Admin Login Failure:</strong> My previous superuser account stopped working. **Fix:** I realized my database file (`db.sqlite3`) must have been reset, wiping out the old users. I ran `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create a new admin account, which immediately solved the problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`TemplateDoesNotExist` Error:</strong> This was the biggest hurdle. My views were working, but Django couldn't find my HTML files. **Fix:** The problem was the folder structure. I had forgotten the crucial nested directory: `recipes/templates/recipes/`. Once I created the second `recipes` folder and moved my templates inside it, Django found them instantly. This hammered home the importance of Django's "convention over configuration" philosophy.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Broken Image Links:</strong> My initial seeding script kept failing because the image URLs from Unsplash were expiring. **Fix:** After several failed attempts, I learned to use a more stable image source like **DummyJSON**, which is designed for this purpose. This was a great lesson in the unreliability of hotlinking and the value of using dedicated placeholder services for development.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="skills" class="section">

        <div id="remember" class="section">
            <h2>What I’ll Remember</h2>
            <p>
                The most significant takeaway is the power of Django's conventions. The `recipes/templates/recipes/` structure, the `get_absolute_url` method, and the automatic data passing in `ListView` (`object_list`) all seem magical at first, but they are designed to make development incredibly fast and organized once you learn the patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll also remember the "Aha!" moment when I linked the list page to the detail page. Seeing the `get_absolute_url` method in the model, the `<pk>` in the URL pattern, and the `<a>` tag in the template all work together to generate the correct link for each recipe was a perfect demonstration of the MVT architecture in action.
